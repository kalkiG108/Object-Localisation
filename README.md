# üè∑Ô∏è Object Localization Project

## Overview
Object localization is a critical task in computer vision where the goal is to identify and locate objects within an image. This project aims to develop and implement a model that can accurately detect and localize objects in various images.

## Description
This project focuses on creating an object localization system using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of images annotated with bounding boxes around objects. The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy of object detection and localization, which has numerous applications in fields such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and image search engines.
